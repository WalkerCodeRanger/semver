# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version full release of the v2.x.x and v3.x.x code lines will have security updates
issued. If you are on an older version, it is recommended you upgrade.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Minor or theoretical security vulnerabilities can be submitted by submitting an issue at
https://github.com/WalkerCodeRanger/semver/issues and clearly indicating in the title that it is a
security vulnerability.

Significant or critical security vulnerabilities that are judged to be inappropriate for a
publically visible GitHub issue can be reported directly to security@semver-nuget.org. While we will
make every effort to respond in less time, please allow up to 30 days for a response. Responses will
include information about when to expect updates and when the vulnerability will be addressed. Based
on the team's judgment, such security vulnerabilities may be turned into issues on GitHub or
directly addressed to minimize the time between the vulnerability being publicly known and a patched
release being available for download.
